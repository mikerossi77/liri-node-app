# liri-node-app
Problem trying to solve:  User can enter a command to either looks up a movie or a song.  App should recognize which request is being made and then execute the correct request against the appropriate api.  In addition take command from a file.
App leverages the IMDB API as well as the Spotify API.  An if statement determines which to call based on the user input, or input from file.
To run the app:  Enter:
node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
or
node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
or
node liri.js do-what-it-says
  This command will run what is found in the Random.txt file
I wrote all of the code in this app.
